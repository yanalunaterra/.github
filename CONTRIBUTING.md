I'm not accepting pull requests for projects with a disabled issue tracker.
If you can see the "Issues" tab, your pull request is welcome!

If you plan to work on a non-trivial patch, let's talk it out first. I will
guide you to make sure your work fits my design. Email me what you're up to
together with your Discord/Signal/Telegram handle ^^
