If you reject intellectual property:
- don't let the imaginary knives of the collective conscious stab you, too;
- don't ask for permission;
- don't bother reading anything below.

I license most of my work under [BSD 2-Clause Plus Patent][] in hopes that it will
result in the least total amount of pain for me and those who care. \_Why?
- It is approved by OSI;
- it has an explicit patent grant;
- it is compatible with GPLv2;
- it is in the spirit of üê° [OpenBSD Copyright Policy](https://www.openbsd.org/policy.html);
- it is the only license on
  [Blue Oak Council License List](https://blueoakcouncil.org/list) rated
  $\color{BurntOrange}{Gold}$.
