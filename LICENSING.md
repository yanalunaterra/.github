If you reject intellectual property:
- don't let the imaginary knives of the collective conscious stab you, too;
- don't ask for permission;
- don't bother reading anything below.

result in the least total amount of pain for me and those who care. \_Why?
- It has an explicit patent grant;
- it is GPL-2.0 compatible;
- it is OSI approved;
- it is the only license on
  [Blue Oak Council License List](https://blueoakcouncil.org/list) rated
  $\color{BurntOrange}{Gold}$.
